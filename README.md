# WP-URLDetails Disabler

This plugin disables all requests from your WordPress site with `WP-URLDetails` in the user-agent string.
You may find this plugin useful if you don't want to reveal your server's IP address to other servers and websites.

This plugin will also log the last 100 blocked requests.

## Wait, what?

That!
When you type any URL into your WordPress editor and click on it, WP actually tries to fetch the title from that
site.
Its owner can find out your server's IP address just by looking through the logs.

TLDR below.
